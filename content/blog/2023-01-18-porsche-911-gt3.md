description: "Carpe diem, they say – seize the day. But we are Porsche. And so
  our motto for the new 911 GT3 models is: carpe secundum – get the most out of
  every second. We know that your time is precious. And every minute in the
  cockpit is valuable. So, we have once again intensified everything that makes
  a sports car: performance, tuning, aerodynamics. Time flies. This is your
  time. Hop in."

In the tail end of the 911 GT3 is a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter flat-six that makes 502 horsepower. The engine is essentially identical to the one that powered the last 911 Speedster we tested, which spun to 9000 rpm and wailed hypnotically. The GT3 offers both a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic (a.k.a. PDK) or a six-speed manual. The PDK-equipped example we drove showcased the automatic's intuitive behavior as well as the engine's spirited responses and intoxicating soundtrack. At our test track, the automatic managed a 2.7-second 60-mph time while the six-speed manual test vehicle snapped off an impressive 3.3-second run to 60 mph.
