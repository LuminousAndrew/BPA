Introduction



Scoliosis is a musculoskeletal disorder that affects hundreds of thousands of children in the United States and around the world. When a patient has scoliosis their spine often resembles a c or s shape and their vertebrae are rotated. Healthcare providers screen for scoliosis by performing an X-ray or physical exam. More than 80% of scoliosis cases have an unknown cause \[3]. To be classified as scoliosis, the patient's spine must measure 10 degrees or greater in curvature on an X-ray \[3]. The majority of people are diagnosed between the ages of 10 and 15 \[2]. Scoliosis has many consequences on the body. It often causes uneven hips and shoulders, back pain, hip pain, and flare-ups. There are six different scoliosis diagnoses that affect children: infantile idiopathic scoliosis for children 0 to 3, juvenile idiopathic scoliosis for children 4 to 10, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis for children 11 to 18 (the most common diagnosis of scoliosis), congenital scoliosis (in the womb, the spine does not form properly), neuromuscular scoliosis (caused by brain, spinal cord, and muscular system disorders), and syndromic scoliosis (caused as an underlying result of a syndrome such as Marfan syndrome or muscular dystrophy) \[4]. When idiopathic is in the diagnosis it means there is no known cause \[4]. School screenings are a prominent method to scan for scoliosis \[4]. One of these screening methods is the Adam’s Forward Bend Test, where doctors or nurses search for an abnormal curve \[4]. Other methods include the Plumb Line Test, The Scoliometer (measure the size of a rib hump), palpation (feeling the spine for abnormalities such as more prominent ribs or muscles on one side of the spine), and the range of motion test \[4]. After these tests determine possible cases of scoliosis an imaging exam is performed to determine the degree of curvature in the spine \[4]. If the spinal curve is between 25 to 30 degrees, then the curve is considered significant; if the curve is greater than 45 degrees to 50 degrees, then the curve is severe.

Current scoliosis treatments include bracing, surgery, and physical therapy. All of these methods have many limitations and risks. The focus of our project is to revolutionize scoliosis treatment which we did by designing our Exposine. With our device, our goals were to improve patient comfort, be lightweight and visually appealing, and promote better long-term outcomes for individuals with scoliosis. Scoliosis exerts a profoundly negative influence on individuals' quality of life and physical functionality. Although precise DALY estimations pertaining to scoliosis are not immediately ascertainable, the condition's impact on individuals' well-being and overall functional capacity is undeniably substantial. By developing an enhanced Exospine system that optimizes comfort, adaptability, and spinal support, this project seeks to ameliorate the burden associated with scoliosis. Through this invention, the project aspires to mitigate the disability stemming from the condition, potentially leading to substantial savings in DALYs and fostering improved management of the disorder. 



Our project supports two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The most prominent one is Goal #3; Enhancing Good Health and Well-being. Our project aligns with this goal by striving to improve the health and well-being of children grappling with the challenges imposed by scoliosis. Through the innovative design and implementation of a new and innovative Exospine system, this project aspires to transcend the limitations posed by this condition, promoting enhanced physical functioning, mitigated pain and discomfort, and an overall elevation in their comprehensive quality of life. Furthermore, Goal #4 Emphasizing Quality Education is intertwined with our device by underscoring the intrinsic significance of education and heightened awareness in the realm of scoliosis management. In tandem with the development of our Exospine, we will prioritize the dissemination of knowledge to healthcare professionals, patients, and their families. This endeavor is characterized by a targeted focus on early detection, optimal utilization of the Exospine system, and the multitude of salutary advantages derived from a steadfast adherence to meticulously crafted treatment plans. By nurturing a robust foundation of knowledge and profound understanding, our ultimate aspiration is to empower individuals to make their own knowledgeable decisions about their scoliosis condition, equipping them with the cognitive tools necessary to make enlightened decisions and proactively participate in their own comprehensive care. This project will entail intricate interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering a dynamic synergy between orthopedic specialists, biomechanical engineers, and materials scientists. 



Problem Statement and Description

Current scoliosis treatment methods are uncomfortable to be worn, awkward to be seen in, and oftentimes even ineffective, causing new sources of back pain and even breathing problems. This is mostly due to the design of the brace also known as the thoracolumbosacral orthosis which is made from a heavy plastic. It contains rigid edges and a hard shell design and minimal padding which is incredibly uncomfortable. Most braces need to be worn for between 12 and 20 hours a day. 



Scoliosis braces are orthopedic devices designed to support the spine and promote corrective alignment in individuals with scoliosis. Typically worn for extended periods, these braces vary in usage duration depending on the severity of the curvature and the patient's age. Their primary objectives include halting the progression of spinal curvature, preventing further deformity, and potentially reducing the need for surgical intervention. However, existing scoliosis braces present significant challenges that impede their effectiveness. One critical concern is the lack of comfort and wearability. Many current designs are bulky, rigid, and cumbersome, making it arduous for individuals to wear them consistently and comfortably throughout the day. Consequently, discomfort can lead to decreased compliance and adherence to the prescribed treatment plan, potentially undermining the brace's ability to correct spinal curvature. The aesthetic impact of scoliosis braces is a considerable issue. Their visibility under clothing can induce self-consciousness and diminished self-esteem, particularly in adolescents and teenagers. The social and psychological implications of wearing a noticeable brace can significantly impact a patient's emotional well-being, potentially compromising their overall quality of life. Current scoliosis braces often lack customization options. Given the uniqueness of each patient's spinal curvature, a one-size-fits-all approach may be suboptimal for effective treatment. Inadequate customization can result in an ill fit, insufficient support, and limited correction of the spinal deformity. Addressing these challenges requires the development of improved scoliosis braces that prioritize comfort, wearability, aesthetics, and customization. Advancements in material science, ergonomic design, and 3D printing technologies hold promise for creating braces that are more comfortable, less conspicuous, and tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. By tackling these limitations, the next generation of scoliosis braces can enhance treatment outcomes, improve patient compliance, and positively impact the quality of life for individuals living with scoliosis.



Needs Statement

A more practical, effective, and comfortable replacement to current scoliosis treatments for children in the United States decreasing back pain and mobilizing/straightening the spine.



Market Size

Estimate of market size and/or population size for potential impact. Do your best to estimate using what is available and clearly state where further data acquisition might be necessary to quantify the market size or end user population size. Be sure to cite your sources.

There are about 3 million children diagnosed with scoliosis in the United States per year. About 29,000 surgeries to treat scoliosis are performed on children every year in the United States \[4]. The majority of people with scoliosis do not need treatment, and only around 30% of people with scoliosis require bracing and 10% need surgery. \[9] Curves greater than 25 degrees should receive treatment \[4]. We chose adolescents because it is the most prevalent` and we wanted to target it towards the most affected age group. We also wanted to focus on fixing and treating scoliosis when the patient is younger so they have less problems as they get older. 



Prior Art:



* Bracing: The current standard of care for managing scoliosis in adolescents involves the use of braces. Bracing aims to halt the progression of spinal curvature during the growth phase. The most commonly used brace is the thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO), which is made of rigid material and worn around the torso.
* Surgery: Severe cases of scoliosis may require surgical intervention. The most common surgical procedure is spinal fusion, where the vertebrae are fused together using implants and bone grafts. This aims to correct and stabilize the spinal curvature.
* Physical Therapy and Exercise: Physical therapy and targeted exercise programs can help improve posture, strengthen muscles, and manage pain associated with scoliosis. These approaches are often used as complementary treatments along with bracing or surgery.



Limitations:



Bracing

* Comfort: Traditional braces can be uncomfortable, restrictive, and bulky, limiting the patient's mobility and participation in certain activities.
* Braces only stop or slow down scoliosis they do not fix it. 25% of brace wearers go on to need a spinal fusion surgery.. 
* Compliance: The success of bracing depends on patient compliance, and studies have shown varying levels of adherence, ranging from poor to moderate. 
* Visibility: Braces can be visible under clothing, leading to self-consciousness and potential social challenges for the wearer.
* Lack of individual customization: Braces are typically mass-produced and may not provide a tailored fit for each patient's unique spinal curvature.
* Braces often leads to pain that did not exist before, breathing problems, weakened muscles, and even scarring 
* “Scoliosis brace treatment has existed for more than 450 years. Yet its success is still controversial. Much of the research conducted on back braces for scoliosis reveals mixed and contradictory results. Also, studies are demonstrating the negative physical, emotional, and psychological effects scoliosis bracing has on children and teens. It has become clear that a better way for treating scoliosis, effective treatment, needs to be developed based on the latest science and tec” 

Surgery

* Invasiveness: Surgery is an invasive procedure that carries inherent risks associated with anesthesia, infection, and complications.
* Long recovery time: Patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery require a significant recovery period and may experience limitations in mobility during the healing process.
* Permanent alteration of the spine: Spinal fusion permanently limits the mobility and flexibility of the fused vertebrae, which can impact a patient's quality of life.
* Expen$ive!

Physical Therapy

* Limited efficacy for curve correction: Physical therapy and exercise alone may not be sufficient to halt or correct the progression of scoliosis, especially in moderate to severe cases.
* Patient commitment and adherence: Consistent and dedicated participation in physical therapy exercises are essential for potential benefits, but adherence can be challenging for some individuals.



Need for a Different Solution:



While current standard of care methods like bracing, surgery, and physical therapy have shown some effectiveness in managing scoliosis, there are still areas where a different solution is needed:

* Improved comfort and mobility: There is a need for a scoliosis treatment solution that is more comfortable, less restrictive, and allows for better mobility and participation in daily activities.
* Enhanced patient compliance: Developing a solution that improves patient compliance and encourages consistent wear or engagement with the treatment would be beneficial.
* Customization and personalization: A different solution that offers a more individualized approach, considering the unique characteristics and needs of each patient's spinal curvature, would be advantageous.
* Non-invasive or less invasive alternatives: Exploring non-invasive or minimally invasive treatment options that reduce the need for surgery and associated risks and recovery time could be valuable.

“But you need intermittent pressure on bones to stimulate growth, and the concavity needs to grow. You cannot “guide” [bone](https://supersimplesupplements.com/product/strength/) growth by squeezing the ribs and bending them while the wearer sleeps or sits. 

Even if bracing was successful, studies suggest that children only wear them 10 percent of the recommended time. They say bracing hurts, is embarrassing and handicaps their lives. Full-day bracing doesn’t prevent [surgery](https://www.treatingscoliosis.com/scoliosis-surgery/), so they aren’t inclined to follow the protocol.” 



Questions



* What are the pros and cons of the current treatment methods?
* How can we prevent the spine curvature from worsening?
* How can we limit the movement of the spine while enabling daily movements?
* In what ways can we make a product that is different from others on the market?

We decided to assess our brainstormed ideas with a standard Design Matrix. The functional requirements for each idea were assessed on a scale from 1-5, with the industrial standard (traditional brace) being assigned 3’s for each functional requirement. To calculate the totals, we weighted their value based on the level of necessity. Some functional requirements were “Nice to Haves” versus other “Must Haves”. Based on these chosen values we gave them a decimal value. For example, the requirement of spine degree change was the most important to us, so we gave it the largest decimal or weight in our calculations. In the end, the Spinal Cord Exospine received the highest score of 4.2 out of 5. After receiving the highest score, we decided to use this design going forward.

Product Description and Mechanisms:



The ExpoSpine is an external device that mirrors one's spine with individual vertebrae attached to each other in the form of joints. Attached to certain vertebrae are paddles that wrap over the sides of the torso leaving the stomach exposed (⅔ around the abdomen). The spine is correctional so when the user bends the device refocuses your posture to counter its natural curve as a brace would, but the mechanisms still allows for all natural movements. Our device is made of lightweight materials and comes in a variety of shades to best match the user's skin color. The contraption is not too thick therefore is less visible under clothing and it is durable to hold up for many years and can keep intact during exercise. 



1. External Vertebrae: Stabilizes the spine by correcting the movements and natural curves that a person with scoliosis has
2. Electrical Components: enables movement- make it flexible and able to move for all-natural movements; can be worn during exercise
3. Wraps to the side of the user's torso: provide additional support for the spine and grips to your back, but it doesn’t cover your stomach at all to eliminate any possible interference with ribs and doesn’t cause discomfort that current braces cause.
4. Paddles/External ribs: increases the surface area of the design to provide leverage, and a place to attach with your back and grip onto your skin



Proof of Concept/Prototype Proposal:



In order to measure the success and functionality of the ExoSpine, various repeating tests will take place. Most importantly we will test the success of stopping and preventing further curving of the spine. We will test this with quarter-year exams. In these check-ups, we will have image screening and X-rays. We will log the degree at each visit to ensure positive change is occurring. To measure the comfort of our device we created a feedback log on our website so patients and their families can record feedback at any time on the comfort of our product. They can also record comments on any other aspects of their experience with our device. Quantitative measuring will ensure the weight of our product remains under 1lb throughout the design and manufacturing phases. To measure flexibility with our device we will have users perform daily activities and stretches to test if a full range of motion is applicable even with the ExoSpine on.

Anticipated Partnerships



To acquire sufficient funding for manufacturing and distributing The Exospine, partnering with large and generous organizations should take place. 



Johnson and Johnson:

The Exospine aims to keep children healthy to set them up for a healthier future just as Johnson and Johnson works to “keep people well at every age and every stage of life”. Johnson and Johnson works to “positively impact human health through innovation” by helping innovators bring their ideas of better healthcare solutions to improve the lives of people across the world. Exospine provides an alternate solution to scoliosis treatment through a new and creative alternative that is best suited to the needs of individual patients. Partnering with Johnson and Johnson would be the optimal option to help fund the creation of the Exospine which provides a more effective and practical bracing option to treat scoliosis and help take Exospine to the market \[14].



New Enterprise Associates:

The New Enterprise Associates' interest and willingness to invest in medical products that work to advance healthcare makes them a successful partner for Exospine. They support companies in all phases of development which is a valuable tool that will assist the creation of the Exospine. The healthcare industry is one of New Enterprise Associates’ key industries, which makes them a reliable partner as they have experience working in this field. Their mission is to “help founders build great companies that improve the way we live, work, and play” which aligns with the purpose of the Exospine as we both strive to enhance the lives of all our clients with innovations that best suit the needs of the users \[13].



CareSource Insurance Company:

The CareSource Insurance Company would be a beneficial partnership for Exospine because in order to bring Exospine to the general market, it must go through a clinical trial. During the trial, the participants will attend doctor's visits to monitor their spine curvature and receive X-rays. Exospine needs an insurance company that will support our trial and covers the expenses of the doctor's visits and x-rays so that the trial is free of charge for the participants. CareSource is the ideal insurance provider since they have a strong focus specifically on health insurance \[15].  



Parents: 

Encourage parents with children who have scoliosis to donate to our product for a better future for their children.



Physicians and Physical Therapists: 

Partner with physicians and physical therapists who can help facilitate and perform our weekly and quarterly spinal tests.



Conclusion



The Exospine is the long-awaited solution to combat scoliosis which affects hundreds of thousands of children in the United States. Prior to starting the Create phase, we did immense research on the problem to best understand its effects and the faults and limitations of current scoliosis treatments. From there we created a needs statement that focused on the core requirements we needed to address going into the creation phase. We focused on comfort, success, and appearance in our needs statement. While there are many current scoliosis treatments, they are embarrassing for kids, uncomfortable, and often inefficient so these were of utmost importance to treat. The Exospine addresses these problems while being lightweight and cost-efficient. Our design uses an external spine that has individual vertebrae attached to each other in the form of joints over the human spine. Attached to certain vertebrae are a form of paddles/external ribs that wrap over the sides of your torso leaving your stomach exposed (⅔ around the abdomen). The correctional spine allows it to refocus to the user's posture and counters the natural curve. Our method is superior to current braces as it still allows for normal movement and goes unnoticed under the user's clothes shirt. Furthermore, the Exospine is extremely durable and made from the highest quality material to ensure comfort for the user. Over time the Exospine will stop the spine from curving and prevent scoliosis from worsening. By treating children early in life, our product will target scoliosis before it is worse. Overall, The Exospine addresses the problem outlined in our needs statement. Once we have secured our partnerships and funding, the Exospine will be on its way to helping the nation's children correct their spines.
